CHAPTER – 1
Food: Where Does it Come From?
Food: Nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink, or that plants absorb.
In order to maintain life and growth.
food is essential for both lants and animals.
USES OF FOOD IN OUR BODY
For energy
for growth
for body functions
for wounds healing
for good health
PLANT SOURCE OF FOOD
(A) parts of the plants as a source of food
1. plant roots used as food.Ex. Carrot,Turnip,Radish,Beetroot.
2. Plant stems used as food : Ex. Potato, Coriander and sugarcane.

1. MILK;
2. EGGS
3. MEAT FROM ANIMALS
4. FISH,PRAWNS,CRABS
5. HONEY
There is a lot of variation in the food eaten in different regions of India.
The main sources of our food are plants and animals.
Food sources from plants:- vegetables, pulses, spices, cereals, fruits, oils, etc.
Food sources from animals:- milk, egg, honey, meat, fish, etc.
Other sources of food are salt and water.
Animals which eat only plants are called herbivores. Example: cow, goat, sheep etc.
Animals which eat only animals are called carnivores. Example: tiger, lion, etc.
Animals which eat both plants as well as other animals are called omnivores.
Example: bears, foxes, dogs, etc.
Vegetarian : eat only the food from plants.
Non-vegetarian : eat animal food like meat , fish, chicken and eggs.
Animals that live on dead and decayin food is called scavengers. Example: hyenas, vulture,
etc.",Food: Where Does it Come From?

CHAPTER – 2
Components of Food
Nutrients: Food substances that provide nourishemt to the body.
The major nutrients in our food are carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and
minerals. In addition, food also contains dietary fibres and water.
Carbohydrates and fats mainly provide energy to our body.
Carbohydrates : cellulose, starch and sugar.
Carbohydrates: These are energy-giving compounds. There may be simple
carbohydrates or complex carbohydrates.
Sources of fats : animal fats and vegetable fats.
Fats: These are very high energy-giving compounds compounds. They produce
greater amount of energy than carbohydrates.
Carbohydrates and fats are Energy giving food.
Minerals: These are elements required by the body in small amounts. It is essential
for growth and development of bones, teeth and red blood cells.
Proteins: These are body-building foods. They help in growth of the body.
Vitamins: These are organic substances that protect the body from diseases.
Roughage: It is the dietary fibre present in the food. It facilitates regular movement of
the bowels and prevents constipation.
Dietary fibre and water are not food.
Balanced diet: It provides all the nutrients that our body needs, in right quantities,
along with adequate amount of roughage and water.
Deficiency Diseases: These are the diseases cause due to the lack of required
nutrients for a long period in the diet.
malnutrition : when a person eats enough of food but his diet is unbalanced, it is
known as malnutrition.
Undernutrition : A person not eating sufficient food to maintain good health is
suffering from undernutrition.
 
Some Nutrients Deficiency Diseases are:
1. Protein: Kwashiorkar - Stunted growth, thinning of legs, protruding belly.
2. Protein and Carbohydrates – Marasmus – Complete/partial arrest of growth, lack of
energy.
3. Vitamin D and calcium : Rickets – Bowed legs, bent spine, deofmed bones are joints.
4. Vitamin C: Scurvy – Bleeding and swelling of gums, weakness.
5. Iodine: Goitre – Enlargement of thyroid gland, retarded growth.
6. Iron – Anaemia – Fatigue, loss of appetite, pale skin.
7. Vitamin K : -Bleeding disease- delay in blood clotting leads to excess bleeding.
8. Beri-beri : - Vitamin B1 - weakness in muscles, little energy to do work, paralysis
9. Night blindness - Vitamin A - No vision at night or in dim light.",Components of Food

CHAPTER – 3
Fibre to Fabric
FIBRE : Fibre is a fine thread-like filament.
FABRIC : woven cloth.
Fibres: There are two types of fibres:
(a) Natural Fibres: The fibres which are obtained from plants and animals. Example: cotton,
jute, silk and wool.
(b) Synthetic Fibres: are made from chemicals substance.synthetic fibres are manmade
fibre. They are also called artificial fobres.. Examples: rayon, nylon, polyester, etc.
Fibres from plant sources:
1. Cotton: cotton comes from cotton lant. Both , plant and the fibre are called cotton.cotton
is grown in black soil and warm climate.
2. Jute: jute is obtained from stem of jute plant.
3. Hemp ;- The drug plant.
4. Flax :- comes from linsee plant used for weaving linen.
5. Rhea or ramie :- is used for making sails for boat and also parachutes.
6. Coir ;- is the fibre which comes from coconut palm.
PROCESSING OF COTTON FIBRE
1. Ginning :- Removal of seeds from fibre.
2. Carding :- cleaning and separating of fibres stuck together.
3. Drawing :- stretching of fibre ( fluffying ).
4. Spinning :- drawing yarn thread from cotton fibre.
5. Weaving :- making cloth or fabric from yarn.
PROCESSING OF JUTE
 
1. Retting of plant :- After harvesting the jute plants ( stalks ) are retted ( soaked ) in water
for 10 to 15 days or more. retting soften the rest of the stem tissues other than fibres.
2. Stripping :- The stalks are stripped to bring out the fibres. This is done by hand.
3. washing an drying :- The stripped fibres are washed and dried in sun.
Fibres from animal sources:
(a) Wool: wool cloth is spun from yarn made from the fibres of the thick fleece of sheep.
(b) Silk: silk thread is obtained from the saliva of an insect called silkworm.
Processing of wool: It involves four steps:
1. Shearing: The process of removal of wool from the sheep’s skin.
2. Grading: The process of separating fleece from damaged wool.
3. Carding: The process after the wool has been washed and dried, it is passed through the
rollers (that have teeth).
4. Spinning: The process by which fibrs are gathered together and drawn into a long rope
and then twisted to make yarn.
Fabrics are made from yarns, which in turn are made from fibres.
Spinning :- The fibres are twisted to make yarn . The process of making yarn from raw
fibrous materials is called spinning.
Making Fabric from Yarn: It is done by two processes:
(a) Weaving: The process by two sets of yarns are arranged together to form fabric. It is
done on looms.
weaving involves placing two sets of threads or yarn made of fibre, calle the warp and weft
of the loom.
The warps are drawn tight in paralllel order, with the weft being interplaced at rught angles
to the warps.
(b) Knitting: The process by which a single yarn is used to make fabric. It is done by hand or
machines.",Fibre to Fabric

CHAPTER – 4
Sorting Material into Groups
Matter : Anything that occupies space and has mass is called matter. Objects around us are
made up of a large variety of materials.
Material : A material is a substance which is used for making things.
A given material could be used to make a large number of objects. It is also possible that an
object could be made of a single material or of many different types of materials.
GENERAL PRPERTIES OF MATRIAL
(A) Apearance : shine ( luster or luster ) or Roughness ( non- lustrous )
All metals are lustrous , some are more and some are less.
wood, rubber or a piece of rock is non-lustrous.
(B) . Hardness ; Hard and soft
Rocks, iron and many metals are hard.
Hard materials may be :
1. Brittle ;- Which break into samller pieces or are powdered when hammered, ex.
rock,glass,salt.
2. Malleable : which spread into sheets when beaten . metals are malleable.
3. Ductile :- they can be drawn into thin and long wires. metals are ductile.
materials like wood, rubber and fibres are soft.
(C) Thorough visibility :-
Transarent :- object through which light may pass .ex. glass some plastis , sugar and
salt solution in water.
Transluscent :- object through which light may pass partially.ex. milky glass, milk.
Material downloaded from myCBSEguide.com. 2 / 3
Opaque :_ object through which light does not pass.ex. wood, metals, rock,wall.
(D) Good and bad conductor of electricity :-
material through which electric current can pass easily are the good conductors of
electricity. metals are good conductors of electricity.
wood, plastic,rubber, cork and certain materials are bad conductors of
electricity.electric current does not pass through them.
(D) Good and bad conductor of heat :-
All metals are good conductors of heat.
wood are bad conductors of heat.
(E) combustible substances :- The materials which catch fire on heating are combustible
substance. wood, lastic,fibre and paper are combustible substance.
(F) SOME MATERIAL MAY FLOAT AND SOME SINK IN WATER.
material which sinks in water is denser than water.
material which floats on water is less dense than water.
(G) SOLUBILITY O A SUBSTANCES IN WATER.
The substnces like salt and sugar , which disappear in water , are said to be soluble.
The substances which remain as such and do not disappear in water are said to be
insoluble in water.
(H) Miscible and Immiscible Liquid :-
when two liquids are mixed and they do nort mixed well, they are said to be
immiscible.
The liquids which mix well with water are said to be miscible.
GROUPING OF MATERIALS.
Things made from wood
Things made from fibre
 
Things made from metal
Things made from ceramic
Things made from glass
Things made from plastic
Things made from rubber
things that are liquids such as oil.
Materials are grouped together on the basis of similarities and differences in their
properties.
Things are grouped together for convenience and to study their properties.
Advantages of classification:
(a) Helps in identification of objects.
(b) Helps in sortingof objects.
(c) Helps in locting things.
(d) Makes study of different objects easy and more meaningful rather than studying each
other separately.
(e) Helps to understanding similarities and dissimilarties among objects.",Sorting Material into Groups

CHAPTER – 5
Separation of Substances
PURE SUBSTANCES : substances which contain only one kind of particles .
IMPURE SUBSTANCES : substances which contain more than one kind of particles .
ELEMENT : A substance made from identical particles of one material.
COMPOUND : A substance formed as a result of chemical combination of two or more
elements in a fixed ratio.
A solution is a mixture of two substances. the substance in larger quantity is the solvent and
the other is the solute.
Elements and compounds are pure substances.
NEED FOR SEPARATING COMPONENT OF A MIXTURE
removing harmful or unwanted components, and
obtaining useful and desire component in pure form.
Methods of separation are
1. Threshing,
2. winnowing,
3. handpicking,
4. sieving,
5. magnetic separation,
6. floating and sinking method,
7. sedimentation and decantation
8. loading,
9. filtration,
Material downloaded from myCBSEguide.com. 2 / 3
10. separation to immiscible liquids,
11. churning to separate cream from milk,
12. sublimation.
(i) Separation of solid from other solids:
(a) Threshing: The process of separating grain from husk or chaff is called threshing.
Chaff : pieces of straw ; waste material of agriculture processes.
(b) Winnowing: The process of separation of heavier and lighter components of a mixture
by wind or blowing air.
(c) Hand-picking: The process by which undesirable components are just picked up by hand.
(d) Sieving: The process by which separate solid constituents of a mixture which differ in
their sizes.
A sieve is a device with many small holes in it , which allow the smaller particles to pass
through.
(e) Magnetic separation: Process by which magnet is moved over such a mixture, the
magnetic material sticks to it and is removed.
(ii) Separation of water soluble solids or separating solute soluble in solvent:
(a) Evaporation: Process by which the conversion of liquid state into gaseous state on
heating.
(b) Condensation: Process by which conversion of gaseous state into liquid state on cooling.
(iii) Separation of insoluble solids from Liquids:
(a) Sedimentation: The process of settling down of heavier and insoluble component from
mixture is called sedimentation.. Example: sand, water.
(b) Decantation: The process of transferring clean liquid without disturbing the sediment, is
called decantation.
 
(c) Loading: The methods by which finer particles are made to settle faster by dissolving a
small quantity of alum.
(d) Filtration: In this process the impurities are passed through a filter. The filter has pores
in it that allow only liquids to pass through ; it can separate the suspended particles or solid
particles.
The clear liquid so obtained is called the filtrate an the left over material on the filter
paper is known as residue.
(iv) Separation of Immiscible Liquids:
IMMISCIBLE :- when two liquids do not mix well with one another.
(a) Funnel: The method of separating mixture of oil and water.
(b) Centrifugation: The method in which mixture containing suspended particles is rotated
at a high speed in a centrifuge and heavier particles settle down. It is used for separating
cream from milk.
(c) Churning: The method which is used for separating lighter particles of solid suspended in
a liquid. Example: butter from curd.
SEPARATING SOLUTE NOT SOLUBLE IN A SOLVENT
Flotation and sinking methods :- This method is used when the components are not soluble
in water and one of the component of a mixture is lighter than water an the other is heavier
than water.
SUBLIMATION :- The changing of a solid directly to vapour, without coming to liquid state is
called sublimation.
· Husk and stones could be separated from grains by handpicking.
· Husk is separated from heavier seeds of grain by winnowing.
· A saturated solution is one in which no more of that substance can be dissolved.
· More of a substance can be dissolved in a solution by heating it.
· Water dissolves different amount of soluble substances in it.",Separation of Substances

CHAPTER – 6
Changes Around Us
Everything around us is undergoing a change.
Change is a continuos process.
Some changes can be reversed and some cannot be reversed.
A change may occur by heating a substance or by mixing it with some other.
COMMON CHANGES TAKING PLACE IN NATURE
1. change in position , sun rise an set.
2. change in colour , sky at night and day time.
3. change in shape. , look at the moon.
4. change in size, a seed germinate.
5. change in temperature, hot summer and cold winter.
6. change in state or form , water on cooling and heating.
7. rusting of iron.
Types of changes:
(a) Reversible change: A change in which the initial substance can be obtained back by
reversing the action. Example: folding of paper, dissolving sugar in water, etc.
(b) Non-irreversible change: Change in which the initial substance cannot be obtained back
by reversing the action. Example: burign of paper, grinding grains etc.
(c) Physical change: Changes in the form of substance but not in chemical identity. No new
substance formed. Changes is sometimes reversible. Example: breaking a log of wood.
(d) Chemical changes: Changes in which substance is transformed into new substance.
Initial substance is lost. Change is always irreversible. Example: burning a log of wood.
 
Ways by which changes occur:
(a) Boiling and Condensation:
(i) Boiling: The rapid vaporization of a liquid when it is heated to its boiling point.
(ii) Condensation: The change of water vapor into liquid water on cooling.
(b) Heating of metal: Process in which a metal is heated to a certain temperature and the
cooled in a particular manner to alter its internal structure for obtaining desired degree of
physical and mechanical properties such as brittleness, hardness, and softness.
(c) Freezing and Melting:
(i) Freezing: The process in which a liquid turns into solid when its temperature is lowered.
(ii) Melting: The process in which a solid converts to a liquid by applying heat.
(d) using pressure to change things
Air can be compresse by applying pressure.
pressure may change the shape of the object.",Changes Around Us

CHAPTER – 7
Getting to know Plants
Plants are usually grouped into herbs, shrubs, trees, creepers and climbers.
From where does a plant come?
A plant comes from a seed.
A seed is covered with seed coats.,
The seed coats protect the seed.
The seed has a baby plant inside.
The baby plant has a tiny root towards the outer side. The tiny root is termed as
radicle.
The baby plant has a tiny shoot towards the inner side. The tiny shoot is termed as
plumule.
Classification of Plants on the of Growth Habit:
(a) Herbs: Have soft, green and weak stems. Example: rice, wheat, maize, sunflower, mint,
etc.
(b) Shrubs: They are bushy and have hard stems that do not bend easily. These are plants
with the stem branching out near the base. Example: lemon, China rose, jasmine, Nerium,
etc.
(c) Trees: These are big plants which have a tall and strong stem (trunk). Stems have
branches in the upper part, much above the ground. Live for many years. Example: mango,
neem, banyan, coconut, etc.
(d) Climbers: Have weak stems and cannot stand erect. They take the support of other trees
and climb on them. Example: pea, grape, vine, etc.
(e) Creepers: Plants which creep on the ground and spread out. Example: pumpkin and
watermelon.
Classification of plants on the basis of their Life Cycle:
Material downloaded from myCBSEguide.com. 2 / 5
(a) Annuals: Plants whose life cycle is completed in the one season. These are generally
herbs. Example: wheat and mustard.
(b) Biennials: Plants whose life cycle requires two seasons for completion. They are
generally herbs and rarely shrubs. Example: carrot, radish, and potato.
(c) Perennials: Plants whose life cycle runs for more than two seasons example: guava,
Babul, and palm trees.
Parts of a Plants:
(a) Root system: The root and its branches make up the root system of a plant.
Root is the underground art of a plant body.It is non-green.
The root grows into the soil and away from the light.
(i) Tap Root: It is formed by the baby root (radicle) which comes out from a germinating
seed.
It is the main primary root arises from the lower end of the stem.
A number of tiny branches called secondary roots. Example: mustard, neem, rose, etc.
(ii) Fibrous Root: A bunch of roots arises from the base of the stem. Example: wheat, maize,
etc.
Functions of root system:
(i) Roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil.
(ii) Roots help the plant to stand erect.
(iii) Roots check soil erosion.
(iv) Roots store food.
(v) Prop roots offer extra support.
MODIFIED ROOTS:
Roots may show certain changes in their shape, size or structure for performing special
functions. These roots are called the modified root.
1. Roots modified for the storage of food: - We find such roots in carrots, radish, turnip,
Material downloaded from myCBSEguide.com. 3 / 5
beetroot, sweet potato and some other plants.
2. Roots modified to provide support to the plant: - In a banyan tree, you might have
noted root like roots coming out from the branches and hanging downwards. These roots
give support to the branches. They are called the supporting roots or the prop roots.
3. Root modified to bear nodules; - On the roots of the gram and other pulses Rhizobium,
a nitrogen-fixing bacteria makes its home in the form of small swellings. These swellings
are termed as nodules.
(b) Shoot system: The part of the plant which grows above the soil.
It includes
1. The stem,
2. The leaves,
3. The buds,
4. The branches,
5. The flower,
6. The fruits,
7. The seeds.
(ii) Leaf: A leaf is a flat and green structure on a plant, coming out from a node on the stem
and always bearing a bud in its axil.
Parts of leaf:
(a) Petiole: Stalk of the leaf with which it joined to the stem.
(b) Leaf lamina: The flat green portion of the leaf.
(c) Veins: These are the network of small, narrow, tube-like structures on both sides of the
midrib present in the middle of the leaf.
The function of Leaf:
(i) Transpiration: Process of losing water by the leaves of a plant.
(ii) Preparation of food by the process of photosynthesis.
(iii) Flower: It is the reproductive organ of the plant.
Material downloaded from myCBSEguide.com. 4 / 5
The function of Flowers:
(i) Help in reproduction.
(ii) These become fruits that store food and seeds.
(iii) Modified flowers like cauliflower, broccoli are rich sources of vitamins.
· Parts of Flower:
(i) Pedicel: Stalk of the flower through which the flower is joined to the branch. It has joined
to the branch.
(ii) Sepal: Small green leaf-like structures on the thalamus. They protect the flower.
(iii) Petals: Brightly colored leaf-like structures present inside the sepals. Petals attract the
insects and help in the process of reproduction.
(iv) Stamens: These are long, thin and needle-like structures. These are male organs of the
flower. It consists of two parts: Anther, Filament.
(a) Anther: The swollen tip of each stamen that encloses in it a small powdery substance
called pollen grains.
(b) Filament: Long stalk-like structure that joins the anther with thalamus.
(v) Carpel: It is a flask-shaped organ in the center of the flower. It is the female organ of the
flower. It consists three parts: Style, Stigma, and Ovary.
(a) Style: a Long thin tube-like structure which is swollen at the base.
(b) Stigma: Small, round and sticky part of the carpel at the top of the style the traps the
pollen grains.
(c) Ovary: Swollen part of carpel that contains ovules.
The Bud : A bud is a compact or a condensed shoot. It encloses future stem, nodes and
leaves.
Axillary bud
Terminal bud
floral bud
Material downloaded from myCBSEguide.com. 5 / 5
(i) Stem: Stem forms the central axis of the plant body.Gives rise to a number of branches
that bear leaves. The stem bears leaves, flowers, and fruits.
The function of Stem:
(i) It provides support to plant.
(ii) It bears important plant parts.
(iii) It helps in transportation of water and food.
(iv) Underground stems store food.
(v) Thick and fleshy stems make food.
(vi) Stem modified into tendrils give extra support for plants.
Some Extra Points:
The pattern of veins on the leaf is called venation. It can be reticulate or parallel.
Leaves give out water vapor through the process of transpiration.
Green leaves make their food by the process of photosynthesis using carbon dioxide
and water in the presence of sunlight.
Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil and anchor the plant firmly in the soil.
Roots are mainly of two types: taproot and fibrous roots.
Plants having leaves with reticulate venation have tap roots while plants having
leaves with parallel venation have fibrous roots.
The stem conducts water from roots to the leaves (and other parts) and food from
leaves to other parts of the plant.",Getting to know Plants

CHAPTER – 8
Body Movements
Locomotion: Movement of organisms from place to place.
Locomotion in the human body:
(i) Human skeleton: It forms a framework that gives shape and support to the body. It
consists of 206 bones. It protects internal organs.
The human skeleton has two parts:
1. The axial skeleton system: It includes the skull, vertebral column and the chest bones or
the rib-cage.
2. Appendicular skeleton system: - It includes shoulder and hip girdles and the limbs ( two
hands and two legs ).
The human skeleton is made of:
Bones: - Bone is the unique combination of flexibility and stiffness.
Cartilages: - It is a flexible bone which gives support to body parts like ears and nose.
It also connects bones together.
Tough fibres, the tendons: - Tendons are strong, white cords made from collagen.
they attach to bones.
Collagen: - Bones in a just born baby are made from soft fibres of a protein called '
collagen '.
Ligaments: - Ligaments may be in the form of cords or sheets.
(a) Skull: It protects the brain. It is a rigid box made up of plates of bone firmly joined
together.
The skull is bony, forming cranium or the brain-case and the face.
Twenty-two small flat big bones join to form the skull.
Eight flat bones are fitted together forming a protective box for the brain.
Fourteen bones of different shapes fuse together to form the face.
Material downloaded from myCBSEguide.com. 2 / 3
(b) Rib cage: It is a flexible case of ribs. Each rib curves round the side of the chest from the
backbone and is joined in front to a plate of bone called sternum. Ribs are connected to one
another by the muscles. Two lowermost pairs of ribs are called ‘floating ribs’.
(c) Backbone or the vertebral column: It is also called the spine or vertebral column.
Backbone is made from 33 rings like pieces.
Each piece is called a vertebra.
It is a chain of small bones called vertebrae.
It protects the spinal cord, which carries messages between the brain and body.
It also supports the skull, ribs and limbs.
(d) Limbs: It is made up of long bones with joints that allow them to move. They are mainly
for support.
(i) Arms: fore-arms is made up of two bones and hands have several small bones. Shoulder
bones have a pair of collarbones in front and a pair of shoulder blades.
(ii) Legs: Lower leg is made up of two bones and feet have several small bones. Hip bones or
griddles bear the weight of the body and are attached to thigh bones.
(iii) Joints: The point where two bones meet. Allow movement to take place. Bones are held
together by ligaments.
(a) Movable Joints: It allows movement between bones and has cartilage between them.
Type of movable joints are:
(i) Hinge Joints: It allows movement only in one plane backwards and forwards. Example:
elbow joints, knee joints and the joint between phalanges of fingers and toes.
(ii) Ball and Socket Joints: It permits a circular movement. Example: the shoulder.
(iii) Gliding Joints: It allows bones to slide a little. Example: bones inside wrists and feet.
(iv) Pivotal Joints: Joint where the neck joins the head. It allows the head to move backwards
and forward and turn to the right and left.
 
(b) Immovable or Fixed Joints: The bones cannot move at these joints. Example: bones in
skull, joint between upper jaw and rest of skull.
Locomotion in other animals:
(i) Fish: Locomotion achieved by lateral contractions of the muscular body with a final
thrust by the tail. Fish swim by forming loops alternately on two sides of the body.
(ii) Birds: When the large flight muscles contract, they pull the wings down.
(iii) Snails: The muscular foot helps in locomotion.
(iv) Earthworms: Move by stretching out the body in front and keeping the hind end fixed to
the ground.
The bones are moved by alternate contractions and relaxation of two sets of muscles.
The bone joints are of various kinds depending on the nature of joints and direction of
movement they allow.
Strong muscles and light bones work together to help the birds fly. They fly by
flapping their wings.
Snakes slither on the ground by looping sideways. A large number of bones and
associated muscles push the body forward.
The body and legs of cockroaches have hard coverings forming an outer skeleton. The
muscles of the breast connected with three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings help
the cockroach to walk and fly.",Body Movements

CHAPTER – 9
The Living Organisms and Their Surroundings
The surroundings where plants and animals live are called their habitat.
Several kinds of plants and animals may share the same habitat.
The presence of specific features and habits, which enable a plant or an animal to live
in a particular habitat, is called adaptation.
There are many types of habitats, however, these may be broadly grouped as
terrestrial (on the land) and aquatic (in water).
There is a wide variety of organisms present in different habitats.
Plants, animals and microorganisms together constitute biotic components.
Rocks, soil, air, water, light and temperature are some of the abiotic components of
our surroundings.
Characteristics of living things:
1. They need food, air and water to grow and for the other processes.
2. The young ones grow into adults.
3. They respire. Animals breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. Plants take in
carbon dioxide and give out oxygen.
4. They respond to changes in the surrounding (stimuli).
5. They all get rid of wastes produced in the body (excretion).
6. They reproduce their own kind.
7. They have a definite life span.
8. They have a particular structure and are made up of cells.
9. They show movement.
Habitat: Habitat is the place where an organism finds comfort, safety, food, water, air,
shelter and suitable conditions for breeding and survival.
It has two components biotic (living things like plants and animals abiotic (non-living
Material downloaded from myCBSEguide.com. 2 / 4
things like rocks, soil, air and water).
BIOTIC COMPONENTS
1. AUTOTROPHS
AUTOTROPHS MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD ( AUTO MEANS SELF; TROPH MEANS
NUTRITION.)
green plants are autotrophs.
2. HETEROTROPHS
( HETERO MEANS DIFFERENT OR OTHERS; TROPH MEANS NUTRITION ) .
Herbivores: plants and grass eating animals.
Carnivores: flesh or meat eating animals
Omnivores; eat both, plants and the flesh.
Habitat provides almost everything to an organism which is needed by it.
ABIOTIC COMPONENTS
light,
temperature,
water, humidity and rain,
soil,
air and wind,
height of a place-plains or hills.
Type of Habitat:
(a) Terrestrial Habitat: Plants and animals live on land.
some terrestrial habitats are
seashore or the coastal area. Ex. lants like mangroove and coconut palm are
common.
on the bank of Ponds and lakes. Ex. frog,turtle,alligator, crocodile,duck etc.
Material downloaded from myCBSEguide.com. 3 / 4
life on land. Ex. cat,deer,lion,tiger,cow. Plants growing on land under normal
conditions of moderate temperature and availability of water are the mesophytes.
desert habitat on land . Ex. cactus,euphorbia,aloe,lizards,snake,camel.
underground habitats. Ex. moles, beetle, cricket, termite, milliped, ant.
plants and animals living on hills and mountains.Ex. yak, bear, hill goat, flying fox.
plants in hills are mostly conical and evergreen. they bear deep growing roots. the
stem is woody, bearing needle-like leaves.plants are mostly xerophytes. Ex.
apple,pear,plum,apricot,walnut,almond.
high snowy peaks and polar regions.Ex, polar bear(white bear), penguin
arboreal or areial habitat Arbor means a tree. organisms living on trees are
arboreal.Ex. was a honey bee, sider, owls, birds and numerous insects.
(b) Aquatic Habitat: Plants and animals live in water. Example: ponds, swamps, lakes, rivers
and oceans.
plants growing in water are called hydrophytes.
plant body is covered with a slippery substance called mucilage.
Adaptations: Presence of specific features or certain habitats which enable an organism to
live in its surrounding.
Adaptation helps an organism in acquiring certain characteristics which helps it in
being able to live in the habitat of its choice.
The adaptation may be (i) related to the habitat, or (ii) related to its body structure.
Terrestrial:
(a) Deserts: Small animals stay in burrows deep in sand during the day, and come out at
night. In plants, leaves are either absent or very smell as spines; stem has a thick waxy
coating; roots go deep into the soil.
(b) Mountains: Animals have thick skin or fur; mountain goat has strong hooves. Trees are
cone shaped having sloping branches; leaves are needle like.
(c) Grasslands: Animals are light brown in colour; Lion: a Long clause in front legs that can
 
be withdrawn inside the toes; eyes in front of face. Deer: Srong teeth, long ears, eyes on the
sides of head.
Aquatic:
(a) Ponds:
· Plants with roots fixed in soil: Stems are long, hollow and light; leaves float on water.
· Plants with roots submerge: Leaves are narrow and thin ribbon-like.
(b) Oceans:
organisms living in sea are called the marine plants and marine animals.
Animals have streamlined body; gills to respire (dolphins and whales have
blowholes).
Animals like squids and octopus do no have streamlined body and stay deep in water.",The Living Organisms and Their Surroundings

Motion and Measurement of Distances
REST : The objects which remain stationary at a place and do not change their
position are said to be at rest.
Different modes of transport are used to go from one place to another.
In ancient times, people used the length of a foot, the width of a finger, the distance of
a step as units of measurement. This caused confusion and a need to develop a
uniform system of measurement.
we use International System of Unit ( SI unit). This is accepted all over the world.
Meter is the unit of length in SI unit.
Motion in a straight line is called rectilinear motion.
In a circular motion, an object moves such that its distance from a fixed point
remains the same.
Motion that repeats itself after some period of time, is called periodic motion.
Measurement: The comparison of an unknown quantity with some known quantity of the
same kind. Measurement of an object consists of:
The unit of measurement.
The number of units the object measures.
Conventional Methods of Measurement:
Conventional measurements have only been approximate measurement. Differ from person
to person. Lack precision.
1. Hand span: Length between the tip of the thumb and little finger.
2. Cubit: Length between the tip of middle finger and elbow.
3. Arm length: Length from shoulder to the tip of middle finger.
4. Footstep: It is the distance covered by a step.
Material downloaded from myCBSEguide.com. 2 / 3
Needs for standard units of measurement:-
Units such as hand span, foot, footstep, cubit, etc., vary. they depend upon the size of an
individual's hand, foot,etc., hence such units cause confusion in measurements.
Standard Units of Measurement: It is a unit to measure any quantity completely and
uniformly. Standard units for measuring, length-metre, mass-kilogram, time-second.
'The system International of 'Units' or better known as 'S.I. UNITS.
RULES FOR WRITING SYMBOLS OF UNITS
1. Symbols for units are usually written in small letters.
2. Symbols is not given in plural form.
3. Symbols for a unit is not to be followed by a full stop unless it is at the end of a sentence.
Motion: When the position of a body does not change with the passage of time, the body is
said to be at rest. When the position of a body changes with the passage of time, the body is
said to be in motion.
Types of motion:
(a) Linear Motion: Linear motion is further classified into two:
1. Straight line motion or Rectilinear Motion: Object moves from one position to another
along a straight line. Example: a group of ants moving in a line.
2. Curvilinear Motion: Object moving along curved lines. Example: a car moving along a
curved road.
(b) Random Motion: When an object moves from one position to another and changes
direction in an irregular manner. Example: butterfly, flies randomly in the garden.
(c) Circular Motion: Object moves in a circular manner in relation to its own axis or around
a fixed centre. An object remains at the same distance from a fixed point which is the centre
of the path of the motion. Two types of circular motion:
(i) Revolution, taking rounds around: Object moves as a whole around a fixed centre.
 
Example: Earth revolving around the sun in a definite orbit.
(ii) Rotation or spinning motion: Object moves in a circular path in relation to its own fixed
axis. Example: blades of a moving fan, windmill, etc.
Rotation is restricted to the central axis. The extended parts attached to the rotating axis are
in revolutionary motion.
(d) Vibratory Motion: Object moves to and fro very fast. Example: strings of a guitar when
plucked.
(e) Oscillatory motion: Object oscillates to and fro along the same path again and again and
with the same speed. Time taken by an object to complete one oscillation is same, no matter
how many oscillations the object takes. Example: heartbeat, a pendulum of a clock.
(f) periodic motion: - The motion which repeats at regular intervals of time is a periodic
motion. Ex. heartbeat, pendulum o clock, hands of a clock.
(g) Non-periodic Motion: Object does not repeat motion at regular intervals of time.Ex.
Earthquake, the eruption of a volcano, landslide, storm.
(h) Mixed motion: - more than one type of motion at the same time. Ex. A cricket ball
bowled shows linear as well spin motion.
(i) Resultant motion: - one kind of motion resulting in another kind of motion is a resultant
motion. Ex. wheels of a bicycle rotate about its axis resulting in the linear motion of the
bicycle on the road.
(j) Random motion: - The motion without any sequence or direction is random motion. Ex.
A buzzing bee, A player of a football on the field.
(k) Uniform Motion: When the body covers the equal distance in equal time interval.motion
of a clock hand.
(l) Non-uniform Motion: Motion in which the body covers the unequal distance in equal
inter of time, the motion of a bus.",Motion and Measurement of Distances

CHAPTER – 11
Light, Shadows and Reflections
Light: Light is the natural agent that stimulates sight and makes things visible.
Its path is only visible when it is scattered by dust particles present in the atmosphere.
Light is a form of invisible energy.
Light itsel is not visible .
It makes other objects visible.
Light and the eyes both are necessary to see the things.
The sensation which helps us to see things is called sight or the vision.
SOURCES OF LIGHT
Sun,
stars
electric torch,
candle flame
Light is classified into two:
(i) Emission of light: Classifying objects on the basis of emission of light.
LUMINOUS OBJECT :- objects which emit their own light are called luminous objcts.Ex. A
candle, electric torch.
NON-LUMINOUS OBJCTS :- Objects which do not have their own light and are seen by the
light scattered by them are called non-luminous objects.. Example: moon, chair, table, etc.
Optical media :- Any substance which allows ligt to pass through it either partially or
wholly is calle an otical media.·
Transparent: All substances that allow light to pass freely through them and through
Material downloaded from myCBSEguide.com. 2 / 3
which objects can clearly be seen are called transparent substances.Example: glass,
water, air, etc.
Translucent: A substance that allows light to ass through it only partially is calle a
translucent medium or substance.. Example: butter paper, tissue paper, etc.
Opaque: Objects that do not allow light to pass through them. Example: book, brick,
etc.
Shadow: A shadow is the 'region of absence of light'. Light from a source is cut off by an
obstacle and shadow is formed.
Opaque object cast a dark shadow.
Translucent objects produce a weak shadow.
Transparent objects do not cast a shadow at all.
Types of shadow:
The kind of shadow depends upon the size of he source of light.
Due to smaller (point) light source: Only one dark shadow is formed and this is known as
umbra.
Due to larger(extended) light source: Two shadows are formed-a dark one in the centre
and a light one on the outside. Dark shadow is called umbra and the faint or lighter shadow
is called penumbra.
The size of umbra decreses and penumbra increses as the the screen is moved away
from the object.
Colour of shadow :- Whatever be the colour of the opaque objcet , the shadow formed is
always of the same colour , that is , black.
LENGTH OF THE SHADOW :- The length of the shadow differs depends upon the angle at
which light falls on a body.
Eclipse: A shadow formed in space that makes the sun or the moon invisible for some
time.Eclips is the overshading of a bright obect.
 
Solar eclipse: The moon comes between the sun and the earth, so that the earth (in
the shadow) darkens during the day.
The solar eclips occurs only on a 'NEW MOON DAY' .
Lunar eclipse: The moon and the sun are in a straight line such that the earth is in
the between the sun and the moon, the shadow of the earth falls on moon and the
moon cannot be seen.
The lunar eclips occurs on a 'FULL MOON ' NIGHT.
(ii) Reflection of light: The process of sending back the light rays whichafall on the surface
of an object. Silver metal is one of the best reflector of light.","Light, Shadows and Reflections"

CHAPTER – 12
Electricity and Circuits
Electiricity :- It is a flow of electic current.
SOURCES OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY :- Electrical energy is available to us from
electric power houses,domestic generators, batteries, and dry cells.
Electric Current :- The Electic current is a flow of elcetric charges ( electron ).
Electric current flows in one direction only.
Electric Circuit: The complete ath from one terminal of the cell ( say positive )
through the bulb and back to the other terminal of the cell ( say negative ) is calle an
electric circuit .
CLOSED CIRCUIT :- An unbroken path travelled by electrIcity is known as a CLOSED
CIRCUIT.
OPEN CIRCUIT :- A broken path is known as an OPEN CIRCUIT.
Circuit Diagram: It is a symbolic representation of the electric circuit and the
electrical parts ( electrical components) .
Component of Electricity:
1. Connecting wires: Help to conduct the electric current and complete the circuit. A
metalic wire used for connections in an circuit is also called a 'lead'.
2. Bulb: Lights up when an electric current flows through it. An electric bulb has a filament
that is connected to its terminals. An electric bulb glows when electric current passes
through it. The filament of an electric bulb is made of a tiny , coiled tungsten wire.
3. Battery :- A series combination of two or more cells.
4. Switch: Switch is a simple device that is used to either break the electric circuit or to
complete it. When a switch is on, a gap in the circuit is bridge by a conducting material
through which the current flows.
5. Electric cell or dry cell : An electric cell has two terminals; one is called positive (+ ve)
while the other is negative (– ve).Inside the electric cell the electric charges flows from
negative (- ive ) terminal to the positive ( + ive ) terminal.
 
Connecting wires, bulb, switch and electric cell is used in Torch, Battery, LED (Light Emitting
Diode), etc.
Electric current is carried by Conductor.
Conductor: Materials that allow electic current to pass through them. All metals are good
conductors of electricity. Carbon is the only non-metal which is a good conductor of
electricity.
Electric current is stopped by Insulators.
Insulators: Materials which do not allow electric current to pass through them. Example:
plastic, rubber, wood, glass, polythene, PVC, etc.
Electricity can give us magnetism
Electricity is a form of energy which helps us with ,
heating effect,
light effect , and
magnetic effect.",Electricity and Circuits

CHAPTER – 13
Fun with Magnets
Magnets: Materials that attract iron, nickel and cobalt.
Natural magnet is called Iodestone or magnetite.
Magnetite is a natural magnet.
Magnet attracts materials like iron, nickel, cobalt. These are called magnetic
materials. Materials that are not attracted towards magnet are called non-magnetic
ex. aer,glass,cloth,lastic,rubber etc.
Magnetic force : The force by means of which a magnet attracts objects towards itself
.
Poles of a magnet :- The ends of the magnet where maximum iron filings get
collected are called the poles.
North pole :- The end pointing towars north is called the north seeking end or the
North pole.
South pole :-The end pointing towards south is calle the south seeking or the South
pole.
A freely suspended magnet always aligns in N-S direction.
Like poles repel , and unlike poles attract each other.
DIFFERNT TYPES AND SHAPE OF MAGNETS
1. Bar magnet
2. Ball-ended magnet ( Dumb-bell )
3. Horseshoe magnet
4. Cylindrical magnet
5. Magnetic needle
6. Artificial magnet
7. Loadstone ( natural magnet)
8. ring or disc shape magnet
Material downloaded from myCBSEguide.com. 2 / 3
Temporary magnets :- Temporary magnets last or a short time.( Iron bar magnets)
Permanent magnets :- Permanent magnets last for a long time. They are made from a steel
or an alloy known as AlNiCo, a combination of aluminium,nickel an cobalt.
Classification of substances based on attraction to magnets:
Magnetic Substances: Materials which get attracted towards magnets. Example:
copper, iron, nickel, etc.
Non-magnetic Substances: Materials which do not get attracted towards magnets.
Example: wood, paper, plastic and most metals.
Methods to make your own Magnet:
1. Single Touch Method: When a magnet is used to rub an iron object along it's length, the
starting from one end to another end like combing one's hair, the iron object gets
magnetised.
2. Double Touch Method: When an iron bar ( object ) is rubbed by two powerfull bar
magnets of equal strength with their opposite poles at the centre, in opposite direction ,
the bar or the object becomes a magnet.
3. Using Electric Current: The bar to be magnetized is placed inside the coils of a
conductor and current is passed through these coils of wire.
Properties of Magnet:
1. A magnet has two poles – north pole and south pole.
2. Similar poles repel each other.
3. Opposite poles attract each other.
4. Magnetic poles always exist in pairs.
5. There is no magnet like monopolar magnet. magnet is always bipolar.
Applications of Magnet:
Compass needle: The compasss is a small glass case containing a magnetised neele pivoted
on an aluminium nail. The needle is free to rotate. It points north-south because the earth is
 
also a giant magnet. The compass lines up with the earth’s magnetic field.
Used in factories for lifting heavy masses of iron like scrap iron.
Call bells an door chimes use elctromagnet.
Loudspeaker have parmanent magnet
Used by surgeons in hospitals to remove steel splinters from the wounds.
Used in the construction of telephones, electric bells, etc.
Used to separate iron and steel from non-magnetic materials.
DEMAGNETISATION , loss of magnetic proprty
A magnet may lose its magnetic property when it is ,
hammered
heated, or
dropped with a force and it strikes against a hard substance.
When two bar magnets are not stored with their like oles pointing in the same
direction , each pole will destroy the other by induction.
TAKING CARE OF MAGNETS
When not in use the magnets should be stored in boxes made from non-magnetic materials
like cardboard or wood. magnets should be protected with 'keepers '.",Fun with Magnets

Water
WATER : NATURAL GIFT
Water is an inexhaustible or renewable natural resource.
Three -fourths of the earth's surface is covere with water.
Nearly 70% of our body is made up of water and the rest is solid matter.
Water is essential for life.
Water which is fit for human consumption is known as Fresh water or Potable
water.
Only 2.6% of total water is fresh water.
Only 0.01% of the total water reaches humans and animals.
SOURCES OF WATER
Rain water
Ground water
Surface water
Rivers and streams
Lakes and pounds
Sea water
STATES OF WATER
water on the earth exists in three states : solid , liquid and gas.
WATER AND ITS FORMS
Ice is the solid state of water.
Water is the liquid state of water.
Vapour or steam is the gaseous state of water.
Material downloaded from myCBSEguide.com. 2 / 3
· Water Cycle:
The cycle of processes by which water circulates between the earth's oceans, atmosphere,
and land, involving precipitation as rain and snow, drainage in streams and rivers, and
return to the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration.
Water Conservation: It is the wise and judicious use of water.
Ways of conserving water:
1. Get all leaking taps repaired.
2. Use a bucket for taking bath instead of a shower.
3. Collect rainwater and use it for gardening and recharging ground water.
4. Wash your cycles, cars, etc. with a bucket of water instead of pipes.
5. Instead of washing the floor use a mop.
· Importance of Water:
1. Digestion of food takes place in the stomach when food is mixed with water.
2. Important medium for the transportation of food, oxygen and carbon dioxide in the
body.
3. Water is used to produce electricity.
4. Water is essential for the germination of seeds.
5. Water helps in maintaining the body temperature.
Excess of water: When it rains or snow, some of the water is retained by soil. Its caused
flood. It effects by damage property and endanger the lives of humans and animals. Rapid
run-off causes soil erosion.
Lack of water: It is the lack of sufficient available water resources to meet water needs
within a region. It cause drought like condition. It effect by acute water crisis, crop failure,
loss of life in all forms due to starvation.
Rainwater Harvesting: Method of collecting rainwater and storing it for use during scarcity.
It can be used for several purposes including drinking, washing, gardening, flushing, etc.
 
Water vapour gets added to air by evaporation and transpiration.
The water vapour in the air condenses to form tiny droplets of water, which appear as
clouds. Many tiny water droplets come together and fall down as rain, snow or hail.
Rain, hail and snow replenish water in rivers, lakes, ponds, wells and soil.
Excessive rains may cause floods while lack of it for long periods may cause droughts.
The amount of usable water on earth is limited so it needs to be used carefully.",Water

CHAPTER – 15
Air Around Us
Air: The invisible gaseous substance surrounding the earth, a mixture mainly of oxygen and
nitrogen.
The blanket of air that surround the earth is called atmosphere.
Air is found everywhere. We cannot see air, but we can feel it.
Air in motion is called wind.
Air occupies space.
Air is present in water and soil.
Air is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapour and a few other
gases. Some dust particles may also be present in it.
Atmosphere is essential for life on earth.
Aquatic animals use dissolved air in water for respiration.
Plants and animals depend on each other for exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide
from air.
Diffrent Layers of Atmosphere
1. Troposhere
2. Stratosphere
3. Meseosphere
4. Thermosphere
Constituent of Air
Air contains mostly nitrogen and oxygen . Nitrogen is nearly 78% of the air . Oxygen is
nearly 21% of the air. Rest 1% is carbon ioxide, water vaour, dust particles and some
other gases. The composition of gases in air changes from place to place.
1. Nitrogen : Plants need nitrogen to grow.
 
2. Oxygen : Used by all living things to respire and help to burn things.
3. Carbon dioxide: Plants and animals consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide
during respiration. It is used by green plants for photosynthesis. It is released on burning.
4. Water Vapour: Formed due to evaporation of water. Amount of water vapour present in
the air is called humidity. Varies from place to place and also in the same place during
day and night.
5. Dust and Smoke: Smoke contains a few gases and fine dust particles. It is very harmful.
Presence of dust particles in air varies from time to time and from place to place.
Importance of Air
Air aids burning.
Air is needed for breathing.
Plants need air to make food.
Birds fly in air. Aeroplanes also go up in the air because of air pressure.
Moving air is called wind. The wind makes the windmill rotate.
Air help in quick evaporation of sweat that helps in keeping us cool.",Air Around Us
15,"Waste:  A material that has no longer any value to the person who is responsible for it.

Sources of Waste:

(i) Domestic (Household) Wastes: fruit and vegetable peeling, polypacks, bottle, garbage, rubbish, excreta, ashes, sullage are domestic wastes.

(ii) office and  Industrial wastes: wastes produced by industries. The common industrial wstes are smoke, plastic, objects, glass, fly ash, etc.

(iii) Agricultural wastes: common agricultural wastes are rice husk, dried stems and straw, weeds and cattle waste.

(iv) Commercial wastes: wastes generated from commercial establishments such as shops, malls, stores restarurants, hotels, motels, printing press, auto-repair shops, medical facilities. 

Type of wastes:

(i) Biodegradable wastes: Wastes which can be broken down through the action of microorganisms into their simple constituents. Example: plant products, organic wastes, domestic refuse and animal wastes.

(ii) Non-biodegradable wastes: Wastes which cannot be disintegrated by action of microorganisms and remains unaffected from decomposition. Example: plastics, glass, metal, scraps, etc.

(iii) Plastics: Many things are made up of plastics like bags, shoes, bottles, pipes, pens, etc. it cannot be converted into less harmful substances by composting.

ill effect of Plastics:

(a) Burning emits poisonous gases which cause health problems.
(b) Foods thrown in plastic bags are eaten by stray animals which can lead to death.
(c) Carelessly thrown plastic bags choke sewer system.
(d) Food stored in bad quality plastics can be harmful.

Management of Plastics:

(a) Do not throw plastics here and there after use.
(b) Do not burn pastic bags and other plastic items.
(c) Use paper or cloth bags in place of plastic bags.
(d) Educate friends and family members about the proper disposal of plastics.

Management and Disposal of Waste:

(a) 3R’s – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. It means the reduce waste production, reuse of materials and recycle and reprocessing of waste materials for making new products.

(b) Landfills or Composting: Converting plant and animal waste including that from kitchen, into manure, is called composting. Low lying open areas to deposite biodegradable waste.

(c) Vermi-composting: Method of preparing compost with the help of red worms. Excreta of the worms make the compost very rich in nutrients.

Use of two type of dustbins GREEN AN RED . The Green one is for biodegradable wasrte, while the red garbage bin is for non-biodegradable waste.
Landfill is an area where the garbage collected from a city or town is dumped. The area is later converted into a park.
Paper can be recycled to get useful products.
Plastics cannot be converted into less harmful substances by the process of composting.
We need to generate less waste and find ways of dealing with the increasing amount of garbage in our surroundings","Garbage in, Garbage out"
